# AngularObservables

This project uses the Observables in Angular 7 to stop a process by using ngOnDestroy to avoid memory leak if a page process is left running when the web page is exited. [Angular documentation on observables](https://angular.io/guide/observables)

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.


## Notes

"The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. Observables, help JavaScript as a language integrate the observer design pattern."
